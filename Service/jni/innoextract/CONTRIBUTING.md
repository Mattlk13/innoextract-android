Contributions of all kinds are welcome as [GitHub pull requests](https://github.com/dscharrer/innoextract/pulls) or as patches mailed to daniel@constexpr.org.

If you are planning to implement a larger feature and intend to get it merged, please contact me **first** at daniel@constexpr.org or on the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/dscharrer/innoextract/issues) to discuss the planned changes in order to avoid duplicating work or having to re-do the changes in a way that fits with the project.

There is no official code style guide, but please try to match the style of the existing code and git commit messages.

All contributions must be licensed under the zlib license detailed in the LICENSE file.
